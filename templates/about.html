    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are very interested in predicting what will happen before it happens. As a club, we believe that it's very useful — and fun — to know the future. We can actually do this! By doing lots of practice, we become better forecasters, able to predict the world more accurately. We can use this knowledge to take actions that change the world for the better (for example: predicting a pandemic before it happens).</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>What is forecasting?</h3>
<p>Forecasting is the skill of predicting the future. We believe that it's a skill that people can get better at with practice. We assign probabilities to events and then score ourselves based on how well our probabilities fit what actually happened (using some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule">scoring rule</a>).</p>
<h3>Are you forecasting the weather?</h3>
<p>While some of our questions might be about the weather, we're interested in predicting the future more broadly. We want to be able to put accurate probabilities on lots of classes of events.</p>
<h3>What types of questions do you forecast?</h3>
Everything! You can see our Metaculus page <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/c/brown/">here</a> for some of our past questions.

            <h3>Grace Yang</h3>
            <p><strong>I’m a sophomore studying applied math and computer science. My favorite part of forecasting is predicting sports results, and spend my free time watching NFL/NBA games, developing data-driven strategy for Brown’s D1 football team, and play volleyball. I also love creating ceramics, backpacking, and finding delicious food.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>I’m a sophomore studying math - computer science and physics. I enjoy using logical frameworks and data to predict interesting events. If you run into me I’ll probably be reading a random books, watching kdramas, or making questionable decisions with my kalshi portfolio.</strong></p>
